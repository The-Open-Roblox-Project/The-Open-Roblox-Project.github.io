		<h2>How to find and get offsets/addressess?</h2>
			<p>
				You can find most offsets using Cheat Engine by scanning for values, pointers, and structures while attached to Roblox <bold>Studio</bold> (Roblox Studio doesn't have Hyperion so Cheat Engine isn't detected).<br>
				Here is a good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzJLyAgjgqY">tutorial</a> on how to find most instance offsets in Cheat Engine.
				If you need to analyze internal structures you can use a <a href="https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/c-and-c-/64775-createremotethread-dll-injection.html">CreateRemoteThread injector</a>(which is not detected since Roblox Studio doesn't have hyperion),
				or open Roblox Studio in <a href="https://hex-rays.com/ida-free">IDA</a>(without dumping/decrypting)
			</p>

			<br>

			<p>
				However, for addresses, especially static ones(which is most of them), you need <a href="https://hex-rays.com/ida-free">IDA</a> to analyze the executable.<br>
				To open RobloxPlayerBeta.exe in IDA you first have to dump it using <a href="https://github.com/atrexus/vulkan">Vulkan</a>.<br>
				Example usage: <samp style="color: green">vulkan.exe -p RobloxPlayerBeta.exe -o decrypted.exe -w</samp>.<br>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>-p</strong>: The process name to dump</li>
					<li><strong>-o</strong>: The output file path</li>
					<li><strong>-w</strong>: Makes Vulkan wait for the process to start up</li>
				</ul>
				Run this command and open Roblox Player then wait for vulkan to analyze to around 60-70%.<br>
				After that press Ctrl+C and open the output file(in this case, decrypted.exe) in IDA and start the analysis.<br>
			</p>

			<br>

			<p>
				TIP: It is recommened to rebase in IDA by 0x0, but you should still ask people if the address they sent you is already rebased to 0x0.<br>
				<br>
				TIP: When people tell you to search for something in IDA they are referring to the string search feature(using Ctrl+F while in the Strings subview) and not the normal text search.<br>

		<h2>What is a DataModel in Roblox?</h2>
		<p>
			A DataModel is a structure that is the equivalent of the <samp style="color: aquamarine">game</samp> global variable in Roblox Studio.<br>
			It serves as the core structure that holds the entire game's environment, including objects, services, etc.<br>
			The DataModel contains essential game components such as the Workspace, Players, Lighting, ReplicatedStorage, and various other services that manage the game's functionality.<br>
		</p>
		<br>

		<h3>What is a fake DataModel?</h3>
		<p>
			A "fake DataModel" in Roblox actually refers to a job in the Roblox task scheduler that manages the real DataModel.<br>
			9/10 times when trying to get the real DataModel you will find the fake DataModel since a lot of objects that "mess" with the DataModel store a pointer to the fake one.<br>
			Most people refer to fake DataModel as fake DataModel or DataModel holder and not DataModel job so people will probably be confused when you refer to the fake DataModel as DataModel job.<br>
		</p>
		<br>

		<h3>How to get the fake DataModel?</h3>
		<p>
			To get the fake DataModel all you have to do is read the pointer at <samp style="color: mediumslateblue;">0x8</samp> within the DataModel deleter.<br>
			For example: <pre>
<span style="color: mediumseagreen;">uintptr_t</span> deleterAddress = mem::<span style="color: rgb(255, 222, 122)">rebase</span>(offsets::<span style="color: gray">Deleter</span>);
<span style="color: mediumseagreen;">uintptr_t</span> fakeDataModelAddress = mem::<span style="color: rgb(255, 222, 122)">read</span>&lt;<span style="color: mediumseagreen;">uintptr_t</span>&gt;(<span style="color: gray;">deleterAddress</span> + <span style="color: mediumslateblue;">0x8</span>)</pre>
			Getting the deleter address is very easy that's why I chose this method.
			Here is a step by step tutorial on getting the deleter address by me:
			<ol>
				<li>Search for "WebMessage" in IDA</li>
				<li>Scroll down until you see something among the lines of: <pre> <span style="color: gray;">LABEL_4:</span>
  <span style="color: gray;">v11</span> = <span style="color: rgb(255, 222, 122)">sub_71E330</span>();            <span style="color: green;">// You can rename this function to something like RBX::DataModel::GetDeleter() by pressing N on it.</span>
  *(<span style="color: mediumseagreen;">_QWORD</span> *)&<span style="color: gray;">v17</span> = <span style="color: mediumslateblue;">0LL</span>;</pre></li>
				<li>Double click on the function to go to it.</li>
				<li>The return value of that function is the DataModel deleter. For example: <samp><span style="color: salmon">return</span> &<span style="color: rgb(255, 222, 122)">unk_5BC01C0</span>;</samp> 0x5BC01C0(in this case) being the deleter's address.</li>
				<li>Now you can use it to get the fake DataModel.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<br>

		<h3>How to get the real DataModel?</h3>
		<p>
			Getting the real DataModel is very easy if you have the fake DataModel.<br>
			All you have to do is read the pointer at <samp style="color: mediumslateblue;">0x1a8</samp> within the fake DataModel.<br>
			For example: <samp><span style="color: mediumseagreen;">uintptr_t</span> dataModelAddress = mem::<span style="color: rgb(255, 222, 122)">read</span>&lt;<span style="color: mediumseagreen;">uintptr_t</span>&gt;(<span style="color: gray">fakeDataModelAddress</span> + <span style="color: mediumslateblue;">0x1a8</span>)</samp>.<br>
			Then you can create an instance class(if you already have one) with that address: <samp><span style="color: mediumslateblue;">auto</span> game = RBX::<span style="color: mediumseagreen;">Instance</span>(<span style="color: gray;">dataModelAddress</span>)</samp>.<br>
